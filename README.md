# The Stereoscope

I built this model for Hugging Face's [AI or Not competition](https://huggingface.co/spaces/competitions/aiornot) with these goals in mind:
- sharpen my Pytorch skills by toning down on abstractions (e.g. intentionally avoid Pytorch Lightning)
- build something other than the (rightfully) popular average-ensemble models 
- play with performance tuning methods (e.g. moving the data augmentation to the GPU)
